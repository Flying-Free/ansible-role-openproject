# Installation of Ruby
# The are several possibilities to install Ruby on your machine. We will use rbenv. 
# Please be aware that the actual installation of a specific Ruby version takes some time to finish.

# [root@host] su openproject --login
# [openproject@host] git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
# [openproject@host] echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile
# [openproject@host] echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.profile
# [openproject@host] source ~/.profile
# [openproject@host] git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build

# [openproject@host] rbenv install 2.6.1
# [openproject@host] rbenv rehash
# [openproject@host] rbenv global 2.6.1
# To check our Ruby installation we run ruby --version. It should output something very similar to:

# ruby 2.6.1pXYZ (....) [x86_64-linux]
